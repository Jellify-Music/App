## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info

> **jellify** (verb) - _to make gelatinous_ <br>
> [see also](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jellify)

_Jellify_ is a free and open source music player for the [Jellyfin Media Server](https://jellyfin.org/). Built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), it is available for both iOS and Android.

> _Jellify_ requires a connection to a [Jellyfin Media Server](https://jellyfin.org/) server to work. [See also](https://jellyfin.org/docs/)

Showcasing the artwork of your library, it has a user interface congruent to what _the big guys_ do. _Jellify_ also provides algorithmic curation of your music (not that you have to use _Jellify_ that way). It's designed to be lightweight, and scale to even the largest of music libraries (...like 100K tracks large).

### üòá Background

This app was designed with me and my dad in mind. I wanted us to have a sleek, one stop shop for live recordings of bands we like (read: the Grateful Dead). The UI was designed so that we'd find it instantly familiar and useful. CarPlay / Android Auto support was also a must for us, as we both use CarPlay religiously.

### üíú Love from Wisconsin üßÄ

This is undoubtedly a passion project of [mine](https://github.com/anultravioletaurora), and I've learned a lot from working on it (and the many failed attempts before it). I hope you enjoy using it! Feature requests and bug reports are welcome :)

## üôè Support the Project

You can support _Jellify_ development via [Patreon](https://patreon.com/anultravioletaurora?utm_medium=unknown&utm_source=join_link&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=copyLink) or [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/anultravioletaurora) starting at $1.

This allows me to prioritize specific features, acquire additional hardware for testing and development, and helps cover operational costs like Apple Developer Licenses.


## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èRunning Locally

### ‚öõÔ∏è Universal Dependencies

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for Fastlane
- [NodeJS v22](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for React Native

### üçé iOS

#### Dependencies

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for building

#### Instructions

##### Setup

- Clone this repository
- Run `yarn init-ios:new-arch` to initialize the project

- In the `ios` directory, run `fastlane match development --readonly` to fetch the development signing certificates
  - _You will need access to the "Jellify Signing" private repository_

##### Running

- Run `yarn start` to start the dev server
- Open the `Jellify.xcodeworkspace` with Xcode, _not_ the `Jellify.xcodeproject`
- Run either on a device or in the simulator
  - _You will need to wait for Xcode to finish it's "Indexing" step_

##### Building
