## Running Locally

### Universal Dependencies

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for Fastlane
- [NodeJS v22](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for React Native
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing dependencies

### üçé iOS

#### Dependencies

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for building

#### Instructions

##### Setup

- Clone this repository
- Run `yarn init-ios:new-arch` to initialize the project
  - This will install `npm` packages, install `bundler` and required gems, and install required CocoaPods with [React Native's New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here#what-is-the-new-architecture)
- In the `ios` directory, run `fastlane match development --readonly` to fetch the development signing certificates
  - _You will need access to the "Jellify Signing" private repository_

##### Running

- Run `yarn start` to start the dev server
- Open the `Jellify.xcodeworkspace` with Xcode, _not_ the `Jellify.xcodeproject`
- Run either on a device or in the simulator
  - _You will need to wait for Xcode to finish it's "Indexing" step_

##### Building

- To create a build, run `yarn fastlane:ios:build` to use fastlane to compile an `.ipa`

### ü§ñ Android

#### Dependencies

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/th/java/technologies/downloads/)

#### Instructions

##### Setup

- Clone this repository
- Run `yarn install` to install `npm` packages

##### Running

- Run `yarn start` to start the dev server
- Open the `android` folder with Android Studio
  - _Android Studio should automatically grab the "Run Configurations" and initialize Gradle_
- Run either on a device or in the simulator

##### Building

- To create a build, run `yarn fastlane:android:build` to use fastlane to compile an `.apk` for all architectures
- Alternatively, run `cd android; ./gradlew assembleRelease` to use Gradle to compile an `.apk`
